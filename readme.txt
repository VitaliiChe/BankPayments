BankPayments project was created using the following stack of technologies: Selenium-Java-TestNG.

Class 'Tests' consists of all tests, which are covering each requirement from task.
From TestNG annotation - @Description we can see the concrete requirement, which was covered.

In this project it is realised Page Object and PageFactory patterns, so we can see appropriate classes:
        CommunProvidersPage, PaymentPage, ZhkuPaymentPage, which describe the pages.

We can process elements from page using methods from classes, located in 'steps' directory.

For managing a project's build was used Maven.
